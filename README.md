# PumaBenchmark4NewAPI
This is PumaBench mark for Hadoop from https://engineering.purdue.edu/~puma/datasets.htm,I rewrite it in Hadoop New API to better support MapReduce Application in YARN.

You can find a lot of docs that talk about the differences between new API and old API, for example http://hadoopbeforestarting.blogspot.com/2012/12/difference-between-hadoop-old-api-and.html

If you want to run PumaBenchmark and have some features that implemented based on new API, I recommend you to use this modified becnmark.

I have already merged the examples from hadoop-2.7.1 to Puma, what you need to do is just to replace your example folder with my code and recompile hadoop
